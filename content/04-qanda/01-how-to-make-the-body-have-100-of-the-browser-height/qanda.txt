----
Answer:
<pre>html {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  min-height: 100%; <span>/* the body can resize according to it's content, but it will always be at least the same height as the browser window */</span>
  box-sizing: border-box; <span>/* you don't need this if your body doesn't have padding applied to it */</span>
}</pre>
